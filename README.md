Hi Fred,

I was able to get the webpage very close to what I wanted. I was not able to get the body text to be centered under the canoe image as I intended. There is a comment in the css file about this.

I tried to put the JQuery links inside the 'head' but it wouldn't work there for some reason. I left it at the bottom of the 'body' section and it worked there?

I used active links for the menu items and the hyperlinks in the body text. They will take you to the correct pages.

I wasn't able to merge back to the main branch in GitHub. There were no changes between the new branch and the master? I was having a bit of trouble following the process.

Thanks,

Keith Elms
